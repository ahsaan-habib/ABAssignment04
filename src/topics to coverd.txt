In this class we will learn the following in details
1. Angular LifeCycle Hook
2. ViewChild()
3. Template Reference Variable
4. Lazy loading
5. Creation and using subscription (Rxjs).


observable subscribe-

  step1:
    created a method in service, suppose in BookService, to fetch  data over HTTP
    -getBooksFromStore(): Observable<Book[]>{
      return this.http.get<Book[]>(this.bookUrl);
    }
    above method will return Observable<Book[]>

  step2:
    create a component property as following
      -softBooks: Book[]
    Now in component we will subscribe  to the Observable Result of getBooksFromStore() as following
      -getsoftBooks() {
        this.bookService.getBookFromStore().subscribe(books => this.softBooks = books);
      }
    for the demo we are calling the above method  in ngOnInit.
    ngOnInit(){
      this.getsoftBooks();
    }

  step3:
    show softBooks in html template
